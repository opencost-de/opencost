 Keep in mind that there is a superordinate object that is to be published and to which the other charges refer. For example, an Open Access charge can then be assigned to this object by term:

APC – Article Processing Charge

BPC – Book Processing Charge

CPC – Chapter Processing Charge

DPC – Data Processing Charge

…

Within the openCost metadata schema, the publication type of the published object can be classified using the [COAR vocabulary](https://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/resource_types/).
